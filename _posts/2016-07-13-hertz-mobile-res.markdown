		<p class="wow fadeInUp">The Hertz Corporation is United States' largest car rental company by sales. They offer the world's most diverse global car rental brand portfolio with the combination of Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty and Firefly brands. Together, they serve in nearly 150 countries worldwide with over 10,300 locations. Besides offering car rentals, Hertz also provides additional services with Hertz Car Sales, Hertz Equipment Rental, and Hertz 24/7.</p>
		<p class="wow fadeInUp">I joined the Hertz Corporation in May 2014 as a UX Developer Intern. Since then, I had the privilege of working on some major projects for Hertz.com. I have included three of these projects as part of my selected work for this portfolio: <a href="{{site.url}}/hertz-style-guide">Hertz Style Guide</a>, <a href="{{site.url}}/hertz-mobile-res">Hertz Mobile Web Reservation</a>, and <a href="{{site.url}}/hertz-app">Hertz Android App Redesign</a>.</p>

		<h3 class="heading wow fadeInUp">Redesigning the Responsive Web Reservation Process</h3>
		<p class="wow fadeInUp">When I started my internship, the development teams at Hertz had just finished making the website fully responsive. However, during this process, parts of code within the Hertz websites was reused to fit within breakpoints, but not updated. This forced many inconsistencies between the code and the design amongst all Hertz-operated websites, sometimes within the same webpage.</p>
		<p class="wow fadeInUp">As a result, all webpages and processes needed to be revisited and updated to maintain consistency with the style guide for a seamless user experience on devices of all sizes. We started the responsive web redesign with the reservation process. This is the process that users would use to reserve their car rentals from the web browsers in their mobile devices.</p>
