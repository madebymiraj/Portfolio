        <p>Whether it be building an emergency fund for a rainy day, investing for retirement or saving for a new car, LINK is a personalized hybrid-advisory experience to help people plan for their financial roadmap and connect them directly to the solutions or professionals that can help them achieve their financial goals. Launched in June 2018, LINK is also Prudential’s first retail product, funneling Prudential’s offerings to serve the needs of users.  </p>

        <p>There was some unsatisfactory performance post-launch of LINK, and I was brought in to help improve the experience. For this case study, we will specifically go over the redesign of the existing solution center and proposal page as part of the LINK journey.</p>

        <div class="journey mt-3">
          <p><span class="h4">Profile creation</span><br/>
          First, we ask users basic questions about them and their finances. Questions range from their age, gender and marital status to their household income, monthly expenses and risk tolerance.</p>
          <p><span class="h4">Needs analysis</span><br/>
          Using the profile information, we suggest financial goals for users and allow them to add them to their financial plan. Taking additional goal-specific information, we utilize our algorithms to show users how much they will need to achieve their goals.</p>
          <p><span class="h4">Savings aggregation</span><br/>
          Now that users know how much they need, we help them figure out how much they already have in savings by allowing them to either aggregate their external financial accounts or manually input their current savings for their goals.</p>
          <p><span class="h4">Financial timeline</span><br/>
          Taking how much they need and how much they have, we provide a snapshot of users’ entire financial roadmap on a timeline from their most short-term goals, such as Emergency Fund, to thier most long-term goals, such as Retirement.</p>
          <p class="highlighted"><span class="card show-card">

          <p><span class="h4">Account opening and funding</span><br/>
          After the user commits to opening an account, they complete an application and begin funding by transferring an initial deposit, or contribution towards their goal.</p>

        <h3>Identifying the problem</h3>
        <p>After the launch of LINK in June 2018, the data analytics team studied and analyzed the user data throughout the experience to identify the critical areas for improvement. We learned that there were major points of dropoffs throughout the experience, specifically within the “Solution Center and Proposals” part of the journey. In fact, there was about a 60% dropoff rate between the “Timeline” and “Solution Center and Proposals” and about a 90% dropoff between the “Solution Center and Proposals” and “Checkout and Application” part of the experience.</p>
        <p>To identify the problem, it was important to not only understand <i>what</i> was happening but also <i>why</i> the dropoffs were happening. So, we conducted some qualitative research for the complete end-to-end journey. Stakeholders from product, marketing, technology, content, and sales teams were brought together in a workshop to review the quantitative data and put together a list of burning questions we wanted to ask users. Using these questions, we came up with a non-leading and non-binary script to conduct some moderated user research. The test was run for mobile and desktop users in a total of 10 studies. While moderating the research, other team members observed, took notes, and later helped synthesized the findings.</p>

        <h3>Experience Map</h3>
        <p>Often times our product and marketing teams have a challenge of alignment while working on a platform as large as LINK because they make decisions without the context of the full experience in mind. It became evident we needed have an asset to help give them a holistic view of the complete experience and how it relates to the issues they are facing with their context of the problem. So, I decided to create an experience map that could be printed out and posted on the walls for everyone to see.</p>
        <p>The experience map tracked user emotion during each part of the experience and allowed them to get a sense of what the users said via several quotes the users gave during the research. Unsurprisingly, the dropoff rates we captured from the analytics team directly aligned with the parts of the experience where users felt uneasy. With the experience map we were able to combine our quantitative and qualitative data to visualize the holistic experience through the lens of the customer. The experience map also helped identify some quick wins in other areas of the experience, such as the way some of profiling questions were phrased.</p>

        <h3>Framing the problem</h3>
        <p>After going through the whole financial planning and goal-setting experience in LINK, when users landed on the solution center they had a difficult time understanding how the solutions we were presenting to them helped serve their financial needs. Users also felt LINK was hard-selling them products rather than guiding them towards to healthy financial future. These concerns along with some usability issues were prohibiting users from committing and continuing through rest of the experience.</p>
        <p>I faciliated a workshop with cross-functional stakeholders from product, marketing, sales, technology and analytics. It was time to rethink the solution center and align on the business challenges, the challenges of the users and their needs. With this working session we were able to define scope, develop a purposeful strategy and form experience principles to set success metrics for us to work towards for the redesign.</p>

        <h3>The old experience</h3>
        <p>Throughout LINK, the experience was goal-centric keeping the user's financial goals at the core of the planning journey. That is until the user landed on the solution center page. The old solution center was structured the by types of products (insurance, investment, income..) rather than by the user-defined goals. This abruptly changed the tone of conversation. The new product-centric layout caused confusion for users because they didn't know how to proceed. It also caused lack-of-trust because users felt that we had just wasted their time going through the whole experience only to be hard-sold financial products that didn't do a good job tying back to their personalized needs.</p>
        <p>After the user selects a digitial product to proceed with, we take them to the proposals page to give them a final summary as a confirmation before they apply and fund their account. The current proposals page felt like PDF document with lots of data points that wasn't easily scannable for users. The page was also laid out in confusing hierarchy starting with the investment asset allocation portfolio that was selected for them, followed by the information we had gathered from the user for the goal, and then finally the initial deposit amount. To get users to the next step in the process to open and fund their account, it was also important that we carry through the changes from the solution center to the proposals page by also making this page more goal-centric.<p>

        <h3>The redesigned experience</h3>
        <p>To reduce the confusion and regain trust from users, I structured the new solution center page to be goal-centric by grouping each of the product offerings by each of the users' goals. This supported the mental model already familiar to users from the experience and made it easier to connect the user's personalized needs with the solutions we were presenting them by tying elements of the timeline into page for a smoother, less abrupt transition. On top of the product offerings, we also provided two additional sections in case users were not ready to commit to a product and required more help and guidance from a financial advisors or through personalized educational content.</p>
        <p>The new proposal page emphasized the user's goal from the beginning by re-introducing the goal icon. We wanted the conversation on this page happen as such: "Based on what you've told us, here is a investment portfolio designed for you. How much would you like to initially deposit?." As a result, we restructured the hierarchy to start with the summary, followed by the recommended investment asset allocation portfolio, and then finally the initial deposit amount. While this proposition would happen traditionally with a financial professional, it was important to humanize and understand this page as such when translating it digitally.</p>

        <h3>The LINK Sketch library</h3>
        <p>Before I joined the LINK with this project, there had been been seven designers owning different areas of the journey who had worked on the product in the past. However, each designer worked off one master file which included all the pages and screens across the journey. One file with all the screens. Over time, multiple master files started to exist with different versions. This made it a nightmare for me when I was onboarded to locate the latest versions as needed. To make the workflow more efficient, I advocated to decentralize the way we designed and created a Sketch library that helped make our experience visually consistent and make it easier to maintain and scale over time. A process for version control and file storage/sharing was also implemented to standardize and fully operationalize the new workflow across the team.</p>

        <p>As we continued to work through the redesign of the solution center and proposal page, we made sure to validate our design early by putting it front of users, testing, and learning early on. After a couple of iteration and testing against the success metrics we identified from the design workshop, we felt comfortable to develop and release the new version. Almost immediately we began to see an improvement in conversions. Where there used to be 60% and 90% dropoffs suddently made almost a 60% uplift in account openings and funding.</p>
